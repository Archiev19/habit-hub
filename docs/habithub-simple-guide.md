Just pick one you like, and it's ready to go!

### Streaks

HabitHub counts how many days in a row you've done your habit. It's like a game - try to make your streak as long as possible! If you forget one day, your streak starts over.

For example:
- Day 1: You did it! ✅ Streak: 1
- Day 2: You did it! ✅ Streak: 2
- Day 3: You did it! ✅ Streak: 3
- Day 4: Oops, you forgot! ❌ Streak: 0

### Calendar View

The calendar shows you all the days of the month with colorful dots. Each color is a different habit, so you can see which days you did what.

- Blue dots 🔵 might be "Drink Water"
- Green dots 🟢 might be "Exercise"
- Purple dots 🟣 might be "Read a Book"

### Reminders

HabitHub can remind you to do your habits so you don't forget!

## How HabitHub Stores Your Information

All your habits and progress are kept safe in a special digital storage called "Firebase." It's like a magical box that remembers everything for you:

1. **Your Account**: Your name, email, and password (the password is kept extra secret so nobody else can see it).

2. **Your Habits**: All the habits you create, including their names, descriptions, and how often you want to do them.

3. **Your Progress**: Every day you mark a habit as complete, HabitHub remembers it.

4. **Your Settings**: If you change any settings (like what time you want reminders), HabitHub remembers these too.

## Using HabitHub on Different Devices

The best part about HabitHub is that you can use it anywhere:

1. On your computer at home 💻
2. On your tablet 📱
3. On your phone 📱

Your habits and progress will be the same on all of them because the magical Firebase box keeps everything in sync!

## How to Get Better at Using HabitHub

1. **Be Consistent**: Try to check HabitHub every day.
2. **Start Small**: Begin with just 1-3 habits, then add more when you're ready.
3. **Celebrate Streaks**: Feel proud when you see your streak numbers growing!
4. **Use the Calendar**: Look at your past weeks to see how you're improving.

## Need Help?

If you ever get confused or need help with HabitHub, you can:
1. Look at the help buttons with question marks (?) ❓
2. Ask a grown-up to help you 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦
3. Send a message to the HabitHub team 📧
